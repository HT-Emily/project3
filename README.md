# project3
Class Project Description: For this project, we will use javascript to connect midi controllers and live data streams to produce visual artistic works. The goal of the project is to create novel interpretations of data available on the web by highlighting the internal formal properties, like symmetry and periodic repetition, in our visualizations.
